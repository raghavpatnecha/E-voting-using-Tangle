# Internet Voting using Tangle
White paper on E-voting Using Tangle (DAG based Block chain)

Proposals to conduct voting pilots using real elections continue to reappear both in the Indoa and elsewhere, seemingly independent of warnings from computer security experts. While the appeal of Internet voting is obvious, the risks, unfortunately, are not, at least to many decision makers. Yet voted ballots sent via Internet simply cannot be made secure and make easy and inviting targets for attackers ranging from lone hackers to foreign governments seeking to undermine US elections.

## Why Blockchain and Tangle 

Blockchain — mostly known for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies — is certainly one of the most talked-about technologies right now.Indeed, blockchain can be that technology that can help us lower our uncertainties about identity and what we mean about transparency in long distances and complex trades, like in election systems for instance. But blockchain has its own disadvantages when it comes to scaliblity and time to approve single transaction. Thats where Tangle comes in. In this paper we aim to describe the problems with internet voting and propose a more secure and effective solution using Tangle. We also explained why use of Tangle for E-Voting can be useful over EVMs.
